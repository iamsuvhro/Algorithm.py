# Algorithms-Scratch
In this repository i will implement all computer algorithms and Data structure algorithms using Python programming

## Introduction 
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
